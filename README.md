This project was our first time using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). I have since learned that SVD is recommended for *dense* matrices. Our implementation of SVD was used on a sparse matrix. If I had time to revisit this project, I would ajust this accordingly. Nonetheless, this project aims to show some of the techniques available in Python through some of their scientific libraries (namely `pandas`, `scikitlearn`, and `scipy`.

# Python Recommendation Engine
This repository was created by Nick Morgan, Antol√≠n Caballero, and Yejin Eun, as a final project for CS-109A at Harvard University.

The html report can be found at [this link](https://nick-morgan.github.io/Python-Recommendation-Engine-Yelp/). This report omits small details to improve readability of the entire process. 

final_report_group12.ipynb includes all of the steps used to create this recommendation engine.
