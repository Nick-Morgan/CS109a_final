# Update - March 2021
- This was the final project during my 1st semester at Harvard University
- This repo is lacking docstrings, unit tests, design-patterns, etc.
- While I believe there are many things that could be improved with this repo (which I currently have no plan to implement), I am choosing to keep it up as I feel hit helps illustrate the change in my coding style throughout the years.




# Python Recommendation Engine
This repository was created by Nick Morgan, Antol√≠n Caballero, and Yejin Eun, as a final project for CS-109A at Harvard University.

The html report can be found at [this link](https://nick-morgan.github.io/Python-Recommendation-Engine-Yelp/). This report omits small details to improve readability of the entire process. 

final_report_group12.ipynb includes all of the steps used to create this recommendation engine.
